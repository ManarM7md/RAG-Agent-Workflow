Reliable RAG Agents with LangGraph, Groq-Llama-3, and Chroma
Introduction
This project demonstrates the development of reliable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents using LangGraph, Groq-Llama-3, and Chroma. By combining cutting-edge concepts from research papers, we create a robust, accurate, and efficient RAG agent capable of handling complex natural language queries.


Workflow of the RAG Agent
Routing: Directs queries to either the vectorstore or a web search.
Vectorstore: For LLM-related questions.
Web Search: For other general queries.
Retrieval: Retrieves context documents and grades them for relevance.
Hallucination Detection: Validates answers to ensure factual accuracy.
Synthesis: Combines relevant context to generate concise responses.
Technology Stack
Embedding Model: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
LLM: Llama3-8B
Vectorstore: Chroma
Agent Framework: LangGraph
Search API: Tavily Search API

bash
Copy code
pip install -U langchain-nomic langchain_community tiktoken langchainhub chromadb langgraph tavily-python gpt4all fastembed langchain-groq
Code Implementation
1. Document Preparation
Download and preprocess data.
Chunk documents to fit the LLM's context window.
2. Routing
Use an adaptive router to direct queries to the appropriate data source.
3. Grading and Validation
Retrieval Grader: Ensures retrieved documents are relevant.
Hallucination Grader: Validates answers against retrieved facts.
Answer Grader: Assesses the usefulness of generated answers.
4. Final Response
Generate responses from graded and validated context.
Advantages of This Approach
Enhanced Reliability: Reduces errors by structuring the agent's reasoning with LangGraph.
Improved Accuracy: Validates context and answers with corrective mechanisms.
Flexibility with Smaller Models: Compatible with smaller, cost-effective LLMs like Groq-Llama-3.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of state-of-the-art RAG techniques into a reliable, efficient agent framework. By leveraging LangGraph and Groq-Llama-3, we achieve improved reliability, accuracy, and compatibility for advanced natural language understanding tasks.
