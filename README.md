Reliable RAG Agents with LangGraph, Groq-Llama-3, and Chroma
This project demonstrates the development of reliable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents using LangGraph, Groq-Llama-3, and Chroma. By integrating state-of-the-art concepts from research papers, the agent achieves robust, accurate, and efficient handling of complex natural language queries.

Workflow of the RAG Agent
Routing
Directs queries to either:

Vectorstore: For LLM-related questions.
Web Search: For other general queries.
Retrieval
Retrieves relevant context documents and grades them for relevance.

Hallucination Detection
Validates answers to ensure factual accuracy.

Synthesis
Combines the validated context to generate concise, accurate responses.

Technology Stack
Embedding Model: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
LLM: Groq-Llama3-8B
Vectorstore: Chroma
Agent Framework: LangGraph
Search API: Tavily Search API
Key Libraries
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -U langchain-nomic langchain_community tiktoken langchainhub \
chromadb langgraph tavily-python gpt4all fastembed langchain-groq
Code Implementation
1. Document Preparation
Download and preprocess data.
Chunk documents to fit within the LLM's context window.
2. Routing
Implement an adaptive router to direct queries to the appropriate data source (vectorstore or web search).
3. Grading and Validation
Retrieval Grader: Ensures retrieved documents are relevant.
Hallucination Grader: Validates answers against retrieved facts.
Answer Grader: Assesses the usefulness of generated answers.
4. Final Response
Generate concise, validated responses from graded context.
Advantages of This Approach
Enhanced Reliability
Reduces errors by structuring the agent's reasoning using LangGraph.

Improved Accuracy
Validates both context and answers through corrective grading mechanisms.

Flexibility with Smaller Models
Compatible with smaller, cost-effective LLMs like Groq-Llama-3, making it highly resource-efficient.

Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of advanced RAG techniques into a reliable and efficient framework. By leveraging LangGraph and Groq-Llama-3, the RAG agent achieves:

Improved reliability.
Enhanced accuracy.
Cost-effective compatibility with smaller models.
